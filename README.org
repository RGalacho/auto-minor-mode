* Auto minor mode
This file provides the global alist variable /auto-minor-mode-alist/ to activate multiple minor modes according to a filename extension pattern.

Heavily based and inspiring on [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/13946304][Trey Jackson's solution]] to this question over StackOverflow..

** Instalation
Copy this file into your load-path and add this line to your /.emacs/ configuration file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "<load-path>/auto-minor-mode.el")
#+end_src

** Usage
You can define more than one minor mode to the same regular expression pattern:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(add-to-list 'auto-minor-mode-alist '(\"\\.js$\" . autopair-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-minor-mode-alist '(\"\\.js$\" . auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

Or if you like, you can assign a lambda expression to group all of
your desired minor modes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-minor-mode-alist
             '(\"\\.js$\" . (lambda ()
                                (progn
                                    (autopair-mode 1)
                                    (auto-fill-mode 1)))))
#+end_src
